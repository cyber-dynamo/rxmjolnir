          <p>
          The MJOLNIR Powered Assault Armor System is a technologically advanced combat exoskeleton system designed to vastly improve the strength, speed, agility, reflexes, and durability of a Pharmacy supersoldier.
          It is the most advanced piece of tactical military hardware in human hands. 
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Spanning over three years of development, Project MJOLNIR encompassed more than just a suit of armor, but as a pioneering effort intended to shatter current technological barriers. 
          In its final iteration, Mjolnir is a highly advanced suit capable of further enhancing the pharmacists' physical performance while also doubling as a platform capable of handling an artificial intelligence network.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Before Dr. P. Chan initiated Project MJOLNIR, the BCPHA developed various designs and prototypes for powered exoskeletons and armour systems,
          including the Mark I exoskeleton (Pharmflash1) and Mark II (Rxhero). The combat systems enhanced battle capability but lack the ability to utilize AI for combat efficiency.
